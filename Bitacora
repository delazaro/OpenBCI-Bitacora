Goal : To design a BCI system that allows a user to control a system by imagining different movements of their limbs. ( 2 degrees of freedom )

Let's try first: 

Testing OpenBCI only : 
To send trought SLS select in the botton right screen on the GUI = Networking and in the far left drop menu select LSL 
Still don't know Data type to select. Need to be checked when connecting to Neuropype
It needs to reset everything. it seems that it will be needed to apply grasse to improve impedance checks



Testing Neuropype 
Play the diagram as it is , works fine ! no issues 

Next step: 

Create a calibration file using OpenBCI 
  -Python Script : 


Create a LSL that captures signals comming from OpenBCI .


In order to LAB RECORDER to see Open BCI ( obci_eeg1 ) first left up botton and then LSL stream ( TimeSeries Raw works ) or anything but None
